# coffee-outlet

This application uses Node.js and Express.js in order to create a RESTFUL API.

PostgresSQL and Sequelize ORM for database?
GET/POST routes

Usage
This application is for users who would like to find a quiet place to study or work with minimal, or no, distractions and possibly have access to delicious refreshments, if desired.  The user may go to the application and read everything concerning an establishment in addition to user reviews by verified users (those who have properly registered with a username and password).  That way, the ratings of the establishments will be more accurate because the user reviewers are known, and operate, by their online identity as opposed to a user who is determined to give a poor/perfect rating to such place without having a registered account which will then, in turn, allow the user reviews to be more accurate and unbiased.  With this user input function, future users are better able to find not only the original places included in the databases, but also, additional places reported and included by verified users.     

Roadmap
Add a calendar aspect for events such as entertainment or community events.  Make it easy to integrate your selected options into calendar of your choice.
Keep users on our page to the extent possible. Instead of having the events link to another site, we want to add a modal to display information about the event on our site.
Include pagination.

Have a watch-list to keep in storage for possible future options.
