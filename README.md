# coffee-outlet

This application uses Express.js

This application is for users who would like to find a quiet place to study or work with minimal or no distractions.  The user may go to the application and read everything concerning an establishment which can be rated by other users who have registered with a username and password.  That way the ratings of the establishment will be more accurate because the user reviewers are known, and operate, by their online identity as opposed to a user who is determined to give a poor/perfect rating to such place without having a registered account which will then, in turn, reduce the number of emotional and vindictive reviews in favor of more accurate, and less emotional, reviews.  With this user input, future users are better able to find a place to study in order to maximize their ability to complete their school assignment or job project in the best, and most comfortable, environment suited perfectly for the user.
